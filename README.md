# A test project 
A test project I have to do. 
Enjoying the ride to discover the new technologies.

Disclaimer : first time using nest.js, chakra.ui, parcel ...

## State
So I could not finish the project (I will keep doing it in another branch for personal learning).

I was currently working on getting the favorite and updating it in the API so I could list and manage them on the front.
And I didn't start the login/test yet.

# How to start the project
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
After starting the api you can start the frontend
```bash
npx parcel src/index.html
```
